## 🏁 Introduction

Hey, hello, how's going 🙂?

This is a documentation of me learning NestJs, coding, discovering, testing, etc.
There's not much to say about this one, hope you'll enjoy it and can help you at some point.

## 💻 Start the app

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And run the project:

```bash
# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```

This repo is based on the [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.
