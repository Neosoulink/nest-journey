# Circular dependency

Sometimes providers can depends each other, but during the run-time, one provider will be resolved before an other one, which will occur an error (a circular dependency).

To solve that error, we can use **forward referencing** or the **ModuleRef**

> ğŸš§ Circular dependency should be avoided as much as possible!
